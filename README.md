### Custom video player

This video player was customized with CSS and JS.

I added a function to play and pause the video with a click on the screen and/or play button, that changes the icon to either play or paused.

There is a skip function to go back 10 seconds or forward 25 seconds.

One is able to adjust the volume and playback rate by clicking and moving the sliders.

Also you can drag the progress bar to move to a different part of the video, with help of flexbox and flex-basis property.

Additional task was to add a fullscreen toggle option, and I implemented a solution using the requestFullscreen method.
